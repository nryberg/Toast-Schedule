Sitting before the Chimenea (sp?), watching a couple of logs dissolve into ashes in a most glorious pyrotechnic fashion.  The heat of the day has passed, the children are passing their way through another night's practice at the drums and fiddle, and all is well. 

I give thanks for the blessings that have been so generously laid on this humble lap of life.  

iPhoto is slowly chowing through facial recognition for our thousands of pictures - little blinks of our history flashing before my hungry eyes.
