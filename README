== Readme revised to task list

Merged the restructure branch and started working on putting pieces together for the full IA. 

Trying to nail down the relationship between users and clubs.

Moving to "restructure" branch.  Moving Clubs up to primary level. This is for a
number of reasons, but most importantly, you can't have a specific club tied to
just one person.  The clubs have to own the members, the members will change
over time, and the people doing the maintainance will also change.  

This means moving away from something I've struggled with for a while now -
embedded documents.  Nonetheless, I think this is the right thing to do.  Need
to keep in mind that a specific user only has rights to their own club so you're
going to have to incorporate an authorization scheme. 



** Wishlist
* Recovery email sent to all members to allow the club to recover in the case of a
lost primary member maintaining the club online.
* Form to connect the users to the clubs (other than their base club (clubs[0]))
