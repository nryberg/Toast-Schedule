Is it necessary to build out a HABTM for clubs and members?  It's starting to look that way, but I'm not even sure it's feasible.  I can say for sure that this is becoming necessary to decouple the Member a little more from the club where the status is concerned.  Yes, it's nice that I can pull the members using the proper query pattern - but, but - it's so much damned work.

.... and it turns out it's not that much work after all.  Yes, there's an issue with selecting people for a club.  But that's solveable.  Actually brings up the issue of non-email aacounts.  And what to do indeed.  Gotta have a name to look someone up.  

And then again there's the issue of roles.  Perhaps only Officers can change permissions?

TODO: Validates uniqueness of the combination. Maybe it's okay to stack the roles.
