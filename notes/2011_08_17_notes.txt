Once the pieces start falling into place, then the logic will flow again.  Until then, the site is effectively broken - logically.

The club is central to everything, and maybe it shouldn't be so easy to switch clubs.  Maybe just associate someone with a club?

Have to get the templates off the ground and research the AJAX section of updating those pieces.  Then we'll be approaching a 0.5 release and start thinking about basic testing with KK, Paul, and ??

Okay - clubs rule supreme.  In order to do something, you need a club.  You can inactivate a club, but you cannot delete them anymore.  There's too much riding on it. 

Next part - invite other members from other clubs - but have to have some sort of inactive/active flag.  Maybe simply being part of a club makes you active.
