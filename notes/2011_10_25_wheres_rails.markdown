= Where the hell is my rails? =


... he bellows weakly on the bus.  It was there when I shut down the computer.  I did shutdown the computer for good reasons didn't I?  Well, it sure as hell doesn't feel like it now.  Auggh. 

It felt like I was getting so close.  The pieces are coming together!  Yay.  Now I can't dance, and the feet are itching to play.  Effinghimer.

The pieces come together to form the semblance of a whole.  Saw that on a building somewhere.

Well - this is a good time as any to sort of review what needs to be done:

* Finish member selection for the club.  Look at how other sites handle this simple task.
* Clean up the styling across the site.  
* Make it obvious to add members, sometimes you need to look. 
* Handle the erroring of an already existing member with _that_ email address. 
* Set up the e-mailing notification of new membership
* E-mail upcoming meetings
* Build out the subscription information.  Rates? $5, $15, $25?  Maybe a $25 set up fee for doing it for people?? Kind of like Hover's concierge service.
* Look at swipe for credit card authorization.  What do I need to do?
* How do I handle check payments?  Do I?
* Build in Google/Facebook integration for login.
* Build in Google+/Facebook/Twitter integration for notifications, meeting updates, etc..
* How do I deal with clubs with moving locations?  Future build out for meetings?  Moves location out of club to meeting probably where it belongs, but the club location should be relatively static. 
* Expand officer roles - somehow.   Maybe a future expansion of relationship?  Check boxes anyone?
* If you're not a part of a club, you shouldn't see the members personal information. Shades of gray, but I think it's almost not worth showing anything _but_ club and schedule
