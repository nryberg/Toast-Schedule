Rerouted new meeting to the show meeting, instead of club.  Probably messed up new club.  Good to have time to work on this, but getting seasick on the bus.  Blech.

TODO: Need to figure out the agenda problem.  This and basic formatting are the milestones to cover before rolling out to basic user testing.  Have to cut the cord at some point though.
