Long time, no code.  

Short term goals:
Pick a theme and push it to all views - use a simplified CSS
Enable e-mail notification 
  Build out password recovery
  Build out new user landing page
Define structure and methodology for payments

Single bugs
Date format in Meeting edit is conflicted between too little and too much detail.  Maybe this whole thing should be unified and put the date and time in two separate fields. I dunno.

Up/down ordinals for meeting agenda items.  What the ??
