Simplify it and get it out the door.  

For a long time I've been fretting about how to handle user management, fooling
around with user authentication schemes which are (in and of themselves)
interesting. 

While this is all to the well and good, I'm spinning my wheels on a greasy
slope that doesn't get the job done, and that sort of violates the principle of
this project.  Later on, I'll dig deeper into a more complex authentication
scheme (maybe some sort of auth based on Google, etc?).

Users own clubs.  Clubs own members, roles and meetings.  Members can also hold
officer roles.  There's a lot to dig into here, and I have the feeling that
Cucumber could really help me with the storytelling.
