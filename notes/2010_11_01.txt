Two months gone, and it's still coming together.  Sigh.

Make some assumptions about the club specifics.  Typical date/time are going to be set (for now), but will be modified for special dates, contests, etc.

Clubs will have a typical agenda - but really, only a few things change:

1) Speakers - zero to many
2) Table topics - yes/no?

Some of the typical details will lchange on a club basis: 

a) whether or not they have certain bit roles - thought for the day, humorist, inspirationist, etc.
b) Order

Use the last schedule leads into the next schedule.  

In the meantime, take out the garbage.
