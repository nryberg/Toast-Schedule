9/3/2010 Too late at night

Couple of revelations:

* Devise and Clearance complicated solutions to a complicated problem. 
* They are simpler in many cases than simply rolling your own.
* Rolling your own is more (much more) understandable than using canned
solutions that don't necessarily play well with the database of choice
here.
* I get really bogged down in the details of something that I barely understand
and then spend a _lot_ of time messing around with errors that don't make sense
* This is a serious waste of time from the overall goal of getting models in
action and creating something that's useful.
* It's better to get back to the basics and then work your way out rather than
trying to puzzle your way through shit that doesn't really matter.
