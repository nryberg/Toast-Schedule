User Experience Principles
--------------------------

* Clean pages that noave no (0) extra stuff
* Users know where to look on a page and what's important
* users are at most 2 clicks away from navigating to another function
* Users can complete everthing necessary to a task on one page that fits on a single screen
* Clea color/style and theme guidance for functions
* obvious and direct navigation - labels vs. links, text vs. images
