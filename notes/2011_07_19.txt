It's been a while since I've seen this familiar blue and yellow screen.  While it's nice to be back in the programming saddle, and it's an absolute joy to use my own Mac, it's still uncomfortable.  Weird blisters are forming on the tips of my muscle memory.  I _know_ I can do this, but the hand combinations are hard to come by.  Soon enough.  It's all very much worth it though.
